# 2024_Easy_Statistics
Code repository for the "Easy Statistics to Shine in Biological Research" Workshop at iMM


In this `Markdown`, we will provide all the elements to help you navigate the Workshop. The entire session will be conducted using R.

The goal of this Notebook is to equip you with the basic knowledge needed to understand the different sessions. We will not delve too deeply into any single topic.

To make the best use of this notebook, we suggest several routes for using it:


# Installing Tutorials

## Manually Installing the `R` and `Rstudio` in your own Computer

You will need to install `R`, the required `R` libraries, and download the codebase. It is crucial to complete this before the Workshop starts to avoid unnecessary delays. 
Please follow the installation instructions provided below.


## Installing R from Scratch

If you are new to `R`, the best option is to install it from the CRAN Website: 
```
https://cran.r-project.org/
```
There, you can find installers for your operating system (Windows, Linux, and macOS).


## Rstudio as the IDE to use

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) includes a text editor and various tools to debug and interpret complex code. Think of `R` as the engine of a car, and the IDE as the components that make using the engine easier (like the wheels, seat, or radio).

We recommend using RStudio for this workshop:
```

```

However, feel free to use the software you are most comfortable with. `Visual Studio Code` (`VSCode`) or `Jupyter Notebook` are also good options.


## Rcommander and XQuartz (MacOS Users Only)

We will use a "point and click" type of interface called `Rcmdr` to help users without R basics.
MacOSX user will need to install XQuartz as `Rcmdr` depends on it to be able to provide the graphical interface. 

You can find the download link here:
```bash
https://www.xquartz.org/
```
You then have to open `XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg` and then install it on your machine.

If you manage to do this then you are ready for the workshop!
